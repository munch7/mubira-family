                    <h2>Roots & Origins</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Gitungo Mubira</strong> was the eldest child of Mubira and Njoki wa Ragui.
                        Born in Kamundu Village, Kiambu, he later moved to Kibichiku Village,
                        paving the way for future generations. He grew up alongside his beloved sisters, Kanyiha and
                        Wahu.

                    <h2>Life & Livelihood</h2>
                    <p>
                        From a young age, Gitungo was initiated into the <strong>Kanyutu age group</strong>,
                        a milestone of adulthood. He dedicated his life to farming, finding peace in the soil.
                        He married Wamaitha wa Kamondia, and together they raised five children who would
                        become the pillars of our family today.

                    <h2>Strength in Adversity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gitungo's journey was not without hardship. His life was cut short in 1918 during
                        World War I. Raised by Mr. King'au after never knowing his biological parents,
                        his resilience remains the true foundation of the Mubira spirit.

                    Gitungo was remembered for his tall, lean build and light complexion.
                    Today, his legacy continues through us—his descendants—and the stories we carry forward.
